# Pattern Project - Service Credentials
# =============================================================================
# This file stores login credentials for services the delegate agent can
# access via browser automation. The agent can READ these credentials but
# cannot modify this file.
#
# Add your account details below. Each section is a service name that the
# agent references with get_credentials("service_name").
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - This file contains plaintext passwords. Keep it out of version control.
# - Consider using app-specific passwords where services support them.
# - The agent only accesses credentials during ephemeral delegation tasks.
# - Credentials never reach Isaac's main conversation or memory.

# Example: Reddit account
# [reddit]
# username = "my_reddit_username"
# password = "my_reddit_password"
# login_url = "https://www.reddit.com/login/"

# Example: Twitter/X account
# [twitter]
# username = "my_twitter_handle"
# password = "my_twitter_password"
# login_url = "https://twitter.com/i/flow/login"

# Example: Gmail (use an app password, not your real password)
# [gmail]
# username = "me@gmail.com"
# password = "abcd efgh ijkl mnop"
# login_url = "https://accounts.google.com"

# Example: Generic service
# [myservice]
# username = "user123"
# password = "pass456"
# login_url = "https://myservice.com/login"
# note = "Any extra info the agent might need"
